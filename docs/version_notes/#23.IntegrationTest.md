# Integration Tests Documentation

## Overview

Integration tests are a type of software testing that validates the interactions between different components or modules
within a system. These tests are crucial for ensuring that individual parts of the application work correctly together
as a whole. Integration tests can help detect issues such as incorrect data passing, communication errors, or
integration failures between different modules.

To apply them I use XUnit and FluentAPIAssertions library.

## `CustomWebApplicationFactory<TProgram>`

The `CustomWebApplicationFactory<TProgram>` class is used to configure the web host environment for integration testing.
It inherits from `WebApplicationFactory<TProgram>`, which is provided by ASP.NET Core for creating an in-memory test
server for web applications.

### Methods

- `ConfigureWebHost(IWebHostBuilder builder)`: Overrides the configuration of the web host to set up the integration
  testing environment. It configures services, removes existing database and connection descriptors, adds an in-memory
  database context (`PersonDataContext`), and sets the environment to "Development".

## `PersonTest`

The `PersonTest` class contains integration tests for the `PersonController` in the backend. It is annotated
with `[IClassFixture<CustomWebApplicationFactory<Program>>]` to specify the custom web application factory to be used
for creating the test server.

### Methods

- `GetList()`: Tests the `GET` endpoint `/Person/List` to retrieve a list of persons. It arranges a mock person object
  in the database, performs the HTTP GET request, and asserts that the response contains the expected person data.

- `Create()`: Tests the `POST` endpoint `/Person/Persist` to create a new person. It arranges a mock person object,
  performs the HTTP POST request with the person data, and asserts that the response contains the created person with a
  non-zero ID.

- `Delete()`: Tests the `DELETE` endpoint `/Person/{id}` to delete a person by ID. It arranges a mock person object in
  the database, performs the HTTP DELETE request, and asserts that the response indicates a successful deletion.

- `GetByPk()`: Tests the `GET` endpoint `/Person/{id}` to retrieve a person by ID. It arranges a mock person object in
  the database, performs the HTTP GET request, and asserts that the response contains the expected person data.

## Conclusion

Integration tests play a vital role in ensuring the seamless interaction of different components within a software
system. The provided classes demonstrate how integration tests can be implemented in a .NET Core application using
ASP.NET Core test server and HttpClient for making HTTP requests to the API endpoints. These tests help validate the
behavior of the backend API endpoints and ensure the integrity of the system as a whole.
